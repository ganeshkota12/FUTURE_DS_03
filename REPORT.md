1. Introduction
Road traffic accidents are a major public safety concern worldwide. This project aims to use data analytics to explore trends, patterns, and potential causes of accidents. The analysis is performed using Python and provides insights that could help improve road safety and inform transportation policies.

2. Objectives
Load and clean road accident data

Analyze accident trends by time, location, and severity

Visualize key insights through charts and graphs

Derive actionable recommendations to improve road safety

3. Tools and Technologies
Tool / Library	Purpose
Python	Programming and analysis
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive development environment
Pandas	Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy	Numerical operations
Matplotlib	Data visualization
Seaborn	Statistical plotting
4. Methodology
4.1 Data Collection
The dataset used for this project contains records of road accidents, including details such as time, location, road conditions, and severity. (Add source if public or available)

4.2 Data Preprocessing
Removed null and duplicate values

Standardized datetime formats

Normalized categorical columns

Identified and treated outliers

4.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA focused on uncovering trends across:

Time (hour, day of week, month)

Location (urban vs rural)

Weather and lighting conditions

Severity and cause of accidents

5. Visualizations
The following visualizations were used to better understand the data:

Bar charts for accident frequency by time and location

Line graphs showing monthly and yearly trends

Pie charts for severity distribution

Heatmaps to reveal correlations among variables

(You can include visual samples or screenshots if needed.)

6. Key Findings
Accidents spike during peak traffic hours (8â€“10 AM, 5â€“8 PM)

Weekends show a higher accident rate, especially Sundays

Urban areas have a higher number of incidents, though less severe

Poor lighting and bad weather increase accident severity

Speeding and distracted driving are top contributors

7. Recommendations
Enhance road lighting in high-incident areas

Increase public awareness during weekends and holidays

Use speed monitoring systems in high-risk zones

Improve road conditions and install clear signage

8. Limitations
Dataset may not include unreported or incomplete incidents

Limited granularity in geographic and weather data

Findings depend on the scope and quality of the dataset

9. Future Work
Integrate real-time GPS and weather data

Predict accident likelihood using machine learning

Build interactive dashboards for public or government use

10. Conclusion
This analysis highlights how data can be a powerful tool for improving road safety. By identifying patterns in accidents, stakeholders can make informed decisions to save lives and reduce traffic-related harm.
