# 🚗 Road Accident Data Analysis Using Python

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It aims to explore trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset to uncover insights that can help improve traffic regulations, reduce accident risks, and inform public safety initiatives.

## 📌 Project Overview

Road traffic accidents are a leading cause of death and injury globally. Understanding the underlying factors behind these incidents is essential to improving safety measures and saving lives. This project uses Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to provide meaningful insights into road accident occurrences.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Load and preprocess accident datasets
- ✅ Clean and transform raw data into analyzable formats
- ✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Identify key trends and accident hotspots
- ✅ Visualize the findings using plots and charts
- ✅ Recommend data-driven safety interventions

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from (add source if applicable).

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing or null values  
   - Formatted datetime columns  
   - Normalized categorical data  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed accident frequency by time, location, weather conditions, and severity  
   - Identified patterns across days, months, and regions  
   - Used correlation heatmaps to find relationships among variables  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Bar plots, histograms, line graphs, pie charts  
   - Heatmaps for correlation  
   - Time-series plots to analyze trends

✅ Key Insights
Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours (8–10 AM, 5–8 PM)

High frequency of accidents on urban roads and during weekends

Poor visibility and bad weather conditions correlate with severe accidents

Speeding and careless driving are top contributing factors

📌 Recommendations
Improve lighting and visibility in accident-prone areas

Increase public awareness around peak hours and accident hotspots

Implement stricter traffic regulations in urban zones

Enhance road conditions and signage in critical zones
